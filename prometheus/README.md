## What is prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that was created by SoundCloud in 2012. It is designed to collect metrics from various sources such as servers, applications, and other systems, and store them in a time-series database. Prometheus can also provide a powerful query language for analyzing these metrics and creating alerts based on specific conditions.

Prometheus is particularly useful for monitoring complex, distributed systems such as cloud-based architectures. It is often used in conjunction with other tools such as Grafana, which provides a dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the collected data.

Overall, Prometheus is a powerful tool for monitoring and troubleshooting modern software systems, and its popularity has grown rapidly in recent years as more and more organizations adopt cloud-native architectures.

Prometheus in simpler terms is a tool that helps monitor and collect data about different aspects of your computer systems or applications. It can keep an eye on things like CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and much more. This data is then stored in a database that can be easily searched and analyzed to help you understand how your systems are performing and identify any issues that needs to be addressed.

By monitoring your application with Prometheus, you can gain insights into how it's performing and identify areas for improvement. For example, if you notice that a certain page on your web app is taking a long time to load, you can investigate the issue and optimize your code to improve performance.

### Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are two related but distinct activities in the context of software systems.
Monitoring involves collecting and analyzing real-time data about the health, performance, and behavior of a system. Monitoring systems typically collect data in near-real-time and provide alerts when certain conditions are met or thresholds are exceeded. The goal of monitoring is to quickly detect and diagnose problems before they cause significant issues.
Logging, on the other hand, involves recording data about events that occur within a system. This data is typically stored in log files and can be used for various purposes, such as auditing, troubleshooting, and debugging. Logging provides a historical record of what has happened within a system, allowing engineers to investigate issues after the fact and gain insights into how a system is behaving over time.

In general, monitoring is more focused on real-time data collection and alerting, while logging is more focused on historical data collection and analysis. Both monitoring and logging are important activities for maintaining the health and performance of software systems, and many monitoring tools, such as Prometheus, also include logging capabilities.


### Why Prometheus?

There are several reasons why you might want to use Prometheus to monitor your systems or applications:

- Flexible and powerful: Prometheus is a flexible and powerful monitoring tool that can monitor a wide range of systems and applications. It can collect a wide variety of metrics and allows you to configure how often to collect them, making it highly customizable.

- Easy to use: Prometheus has a simple user interface that allows you to easily view and analyze the collected data. It also has a rich set of documentation and a large community, which can make it easier to get started with and troubleshoot any issues you might encounter.

- Scalable: Prometheus is designed to be highly scalable, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and monitor many systems or applications simultaneously. It can also be integrated with other tools and systems to provide a comprehensive monitoring solution.

- Alerting: Prometheus provides a flexible alerting system that can be configured to notify you when certain thresholds are exceeded or certain events occur. This can help you identify and address issues before they become serious problems.

### Use cases for Prometheus

Prometheus can monitor a wide range of systems and applications, including:

- Servers: Prometheus can collect metrics from servers, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network activity.

- Containers: Prometheus can monitor containerized applications and infrastructure, such as those running on Kubernetes or Docker.

- Databases: Prometheus can monitor popular databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, tracking metrics such as query performance, connection usage, and more.

- Applications: Prometheus can monitor the performance and behavior of applications, collecting metrics such as request latency, error rates, and more.

- Infrastructure components: Prometheus can monitor infrastructure components such as load balancers, proxies, and caches, providing visibility into their performance and behavior.

- Cloud services: Prometheus can also monitor various cloud services such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, collecting metrics related to their usage and performance.

Overall, Prometheus can monitor a wide range of systems and applications, making it a valuable tool for organizations that need to monitor and troubleshoot complex, distributed systems.gi
